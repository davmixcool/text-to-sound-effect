# Soundpen Model


## Installation

- Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts. You can create a virtual environment using venv:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

- Install the Libraries from requirements.txt:
Use pip3 to install all the libraries listed in your requirements.txt file:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

- After running the above commands, you can verify the installation of the packages by listing them:

pip3 list



## Example Workflow


### Data Collection:

- Collect 10,000 sound effects with descriptions.
- Ensure diversity in sounds (e.g., environmental, mechanical, animal sounds).


### Data Preprocessing:

- Normalize and preprocess all sound files.
- Tokenize text descriptions using a tokenizer.

`python description.py`

`python preprocess.py`

`python tokenizer.py`

### Model Training:

- Choose a WaveNet model.
- Train the model on the preprocessed dataset using a suitable loss function (e.g., mean squared error for waveform differences).

`python train.py`

### Evaluation:

- Validate the model using a holdout set.
- Conduct human evaluations for subjective quality assessment.

`python evaluate.py`

### Fine-Tuning and Example:

- Fine-tune based on feedback.
- Deploy the model within an application that converts user input text to sound effects.

`python finetune.py`

`python example.py`


### Summary:

- Check the number of parameters in the model.

`python summary.py`


## Challenges and Considerations

- Data Quality: *Ensure high-quality, diverse sound samples and accurate text annotations.*
- Model Complexity: *Balance between model complexity and computational resources.*
- Generalization: *Ensure the model can generalize to unseen text descriptions and sound types.*
- Subjective Evaluation: *Incorporate human feedback loops for better quality assessment.*

By following these steps and addressing the challenges, you can develop a robust generative AI model for converting text to sound effects.
